# Atlanta Brewery Tours

Atlanta has a fast growing craft beer culture.  With breweries popping up all over the city it's tough to keep track of who's who.  Almost all of the local breweries offer tours and tastings both during the week and on weekends.  This can be a great way to enjoy a nice day on the patio and share some great beers with friends.

## What's the deal?

Generally speaking Georgia breweries are not allowed to sell alcohol or food when they reach a certain size.  Instead you can go to the source and buy a $10-$12 souvenir glass with which your favorite bartender will pour up to 32oz of free beer.  Along the way you can visit the gift shop, take a tour of the brewhouse, enjoy some live music, partake in some cornhole, or just enjoy some nice weather on the patio.

## But where should we go?

Brewery tours are all over the map (pun intended) in terms of when they're offered.  If you're from out of town, or a local who has friends visiting it's tough to know exactly who is open on any given day of the week.  Rather than browsing twenty different websites what if they were all in one place?

## Support your local breweries!
